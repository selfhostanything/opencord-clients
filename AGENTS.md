# AGENTS.md

Rules for agents working in `opencord-clients`.

- Use Node.js 26 through `fnm` before running package commands.
- Use `pnpm` for installs, dependency updates, tests, and builds.
- Prefer package-manager and generator commands over direct manifest edits.
- Use readable version-number pins for package dependencies, runtimes, CI
  actions, and container images. Do not pin them by commit SHA, image digest, or
  other hash-style references unless a human explicitly approves a narrow
  exception.
- Use TDD for behavior changes.
- Keep the official clients Apache-2.0 licensed.
- The official web client must be able to connect to any compatible OpenCord server URL.
- Do not implement Phase 01 chat, media, meeting, or bot features in Phase 00.

Before Node commands:

```bash
fnm use 26
node --version
pnpm --version
```
