The web shell defaults to `http://localhost:8080` and can add, switch, remove,
and persist multiple compatible OpenCord server connections.

Verified customer custom domains work as normal server URLs. For example, once
`customer.example.com` resolves through the OpenCord ingress and the server
custom-domain mapping is active, the official web, desktop, and mobile clients
can connect to `https://customer.example.com`.
